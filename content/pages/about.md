# Welcome to **Why Not, Vishal**

This website embodies a simple yet profound answer to life's many questions: **"Why not?"** 

Throughout my journey, I've faced endless inquiries whenever I ventured into something new—whether it was leaving a job, diving into music, making spontaneous trips, or transitioning from a biotech background into data science. My answer to all those doubts and hesitations has always been the same: **"Why not?"**

I have immense respect for those who encourage exploration, who push us to break free from self-imposed limits. These people, who often said **"Why not, Vishal?"** when I questioned myself, helped me shed the burden of self-doubt. They inspired me to embrace learning, to try new things, and to reimagine what I could become.

This website is my way of honoring that spirit of curiosity and courage. It’s a space where I celebrate growth, creativity, and the joy of taking risks—whether through **music**, **travel**, **data science**, or **personal reflections**. **Why not share this journey with the world?**

Feel free to navigate through the sections of this website and join me on this journey. Together, let’s ask the only question that truly matters: **Why not?**

### AI/Data Science

With over 7 years of experience in data science, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights and building innovative solutions that make a real-world impact. My expertise lies in:

- **Developing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Models**:  
  From predictive analytics to recommendation systems, I have crafted ML/DL models that drive efficiency, optimize decision-making, and enhance user experiences across industries.

- **Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Real-World Applications**:  
  I focus on applying AI technologies to solve complex challenges—whether it’s automating workflows, enhancing customer interactions, or providing data-driven strategies that scale.

- **Designing Solutions with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:  
  I create intelligent systems powered by LLMs and NLP to understand, process, and generate human-like text. These solutions have ranged from chatbots and content generation to sentiment analysis and customer feedback mining.


### Travel

Traveling isn’t just something I do—it’s a way of life that fuels my creativity and inspires my work. I’ve explored approximately **68%** of this vast and diverse country, **India**, from the towering mountains of the north to the sunlit coasts of the south. Each journey has shaped my perspective, enriched my craft, and reminded me just how much more there is to see, and every day try to catch that sunset if not sunrise.

Now, I’m working harder to put those **VISA stamps** on my passport. South America, Persia, Europe, and so many other places are calling me, and I can’t wait to answer. Every destination holds the promise of new stories, lessons, and connections waiting to be discovered.

My approach to travel is rooted in **solo slow travel**—taking the time to immerse myself in the local culture, meet new people, and pick up new skills along the way. Every journey, whether it’s across India or beyond borders, has taught me adaptability, curiosity, and the art of living fully.

Through this website, I share the stories and inspirations gathered along the way. Feel free to explore my **music**, **thoughts**, and **travel tales**, and let’s celebrate the endless possibilities that travel brings.

I used to think I was a mountain person—until I saw the fresh, clean seas. But then, I finally realized: I’m an island person at heart. There’s something about the isolation, the serenity, and the rhythm of island life that resonates deeply with me.

### Music Releases

Music has always been my way of weaving emotions into soundscapes, blending genres, and experimenting with instruments to create something truly unique. Over time, I’ve released multiple tracks that reflect my journey, my emotions, and my love for music. Some of my notable releases include:

- **[Dhun - Echoes of Tuco](https://open.spotify.com/track/0dwQF1AOpDMVltfT7yhd6Y)**  
  A heartfelt tribute to unconditional love and loss, this track carries a somber yet hopeful tone, featuring the rich harmonies of cellos and trombones, supported by a gentle 6/8 rhythm. It’s not just a song—it’s a story, a memory, and a reflection of deep personal emotions.

- **[Udna Kyu Na Chahun](https://open.spotify.com/track/2CfWGWWVeLrmGEPCSGW2m5)**  
  A song that soars with dreams and aspirations, combining modern melodies with subtle folk undertones. It’s a reminder to embrace freedom and pursue what sets your soul on fire, no matter the odds.

- **[Mann Baawre](https://open.spotify.com/track/2LsVvf5pwMq3DkyEzMOVXX)**  
  A track about resilience and rising above life’s setbacks, written during a transformative phase in my life. With ghatam percussion and a blend of acoustic and orchestral elements, it’s a celebration of inner strength and determination.

### **The Sound of My Music**

My compositions are crafted with heart and an unyielding desire to experiment. I love blending instruments and elements from diverse genres and cultures to create something truly special. You’ll hear:  
- **Cellos and Trombones**, bringing depth and texture.  
- **Indian Folk Instruments**, like the ghatam and morsing, infusing earthy, traditional vibes.  
- **Piano and Guitar**, bridging classical tones with contemporary melodies.  
- **Layered Vocals and Harmonies**, adding emotional resonance to every track.

Music, to me, is a language of connection—a way to share experiences, evoke emotions, and inspire others. Through this site, I hope to share not just my music but the stories behind every note and lyric.
