# About Me

Welcome to **Why Not Vishal**, a space where creativity meets logic, and stories come alive through music, data, and travel.

I’m **Vishal Sharma**, a musician, data scientist, and traveler who believes in the power of art and technology to connect people and share experiences.

### Data Science
With over 7 years of experience in data science, I specialize in:
- Building predictive models
- Leveraging AI for real-world applications
- Experimenting with LLMs to answer challenging questions

### Travel
Exploring new places fuels my creativity. Whether it’s the serene mountains of Himachal or the vibrant streets of Rajasthan, each journey inspires my art and work.

Feel free to explore my music, thoughts, and adventures. Let’s connect on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iamvishalssharma) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@VishalSharmaOfficialMusic).
