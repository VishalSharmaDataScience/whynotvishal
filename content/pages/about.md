# Welcome to **Why Not Vishal**

This website embodies a simple yet profound answer to life's many questions: **"Why not?"** 

Throughout my journey, I've faced endless inquiries whenever I ventured into something new—whether it was leaving a job, diving into music, making spontaneous trips, or transitioning from a biotech background into data science. My answer to all those doubts and hesitations has always been the same: **"Why not?"**

I have immense respect for those who encourage exploration, who push us to break free from self-imposed limits. These people, who often said **"Why not, Vishal?"** when I questioned myself, helped me shed the burden of self-doubt. They inspired me to embrace learning, to try new things, and to reimagine what I could become.

This website is my way of honoring that spirit of curiosity and courage. It’s a space where I celebrate growth, creativity, and the joy of taking risks—whether through **music**, **travel**, **data science**, or **personal reflections**. **Why not share this journey with the world?**
